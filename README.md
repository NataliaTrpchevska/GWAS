GWAS_meta-analysis_Age_related_hearing_loss


This repository was used for analysis of genomic data published as"Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies 48 risk variants and 
highlights the role of the stria vascularis in hearing loss" accepted to "American Journal of Human Genetics".
The GWAS summary statistics for this analysis can be downloaded here :https://zenodo.org/record/5769707#.Ybm6v33MKhx

The repository includes :
	1. GWAS_Processing - R and bash scripts for basing QC of METAL summary statistics, and codes for gene prioritization and pathway analysis. 
     		Output tables can be found as supplementary tables in the publication.
	2. Genetic_correlation - codes for data preparation and LDSC regression analysis, obtaining SNP-h2. Codes for LDHub trait correlation and LDSC 			regression analysis of gwasOmnibus dataset generated by Psychiatric Genomic Consortium
	3. Expression - codes for data preparation and normalization of different cells for expression analysis. 
     		Codes for processing of cochlear and other scRNAseq data and visualization.
	4. Plots - codes for Manhattan gene-based analysis plot and forestplots for each individual locus
